How my firefighter experience influenced my engineering manager leadership style
I joined the youth group of the local voluntary fire department when I was 12 years old. As a teenager, you are not aware that the youth instructors applied a very smart mix of fun, training, repetition and strict commands to transform us from clumsy youngsters to real firefighters. Later, I have been understood that it wasn't an easy task. I learned how difficult it is to motivate teenagers and train them when I took over the youth instructor role and slowly got into this business. It is unbelievable, how different boys and girls between 11 and 15 can be. It is a challenge to prepare, train and guide them for up to 4 years while keeping them motivated until they can finally join the crew of adults who fights the fire and rescues the cats.
One could think this action itself already motivates voluntary firefighters to join weekly trainings in the evening, yearly multi-day trainings, and take over responsibilities and thus, sacrifice their free time. I have learned that this is not that easy after I was more involved in management and finally after 15 years, was elected for  the deputy fire chief of our department. 
Trust, voluntary people don't follow you just because you have a higher rank. You need trust and people have to believe in you that you can handle an operation. If you give the command to enter a burning house, people will only follow your commands if they trust you. 
If you give an order that people have to show up at the next training next week, the won't. They don't have to. It is not the army, it is not their job, the will find excuses and will fade out. I have experienced hard times when our crew of active people has shrinked from 50 to 20 people. 
Engineers work almost voluntarily for you. They earn a lot of money but as they work for you, they are good and they will find another good job immediately. So money won't be a long motivator and you have to keep them motivated.

Why I continue my side project
Ten years ago, I co-founded a product which allows users to prepare online for the driving license exam in Austria. Until this point in time, it was only possible to prepare for the exam using expensive CD-Roms or USB-Sticks that have been sold by the driving schools. In the beginning, the idea was focused on benefit but we quickly found out that it is really difficult to disrupt the Austrian network of driving schools and publishers of learning material. Too strong was the bonding between them and so we couldn't compete with the long-established publishers who provided not only the CD-Rom to prepare but also teaching equipment for the driving schools. Very soon we changed the strategy and offered our learning platform for free, financed by ads.

Databases? Use files!
Ten years ago, when I held my databases introduction lecture at the University Innsbruck I always showed one slide to explain the drawbacks of files and to motivate the field of databases.
