I am not familiar with the IoT community in The Netherlands or in general, so I was quite surprised about the high quality of speakers and interesting projects at this [sensemakers meetup](https://www.meetup.com/sensemakersams/events/xgqtlrybcdbzb/) with around 100 people. To my surprise there weren’t a lot of young people which I would have expected in the hipster domain of IoT.

[Tanguy Coenen](https://twitter.com/tanguycoenen) presented  [Imec](https://www.imec-int.com/) and was “teasering” some IoT projects on a very high level. 
* Belgium company with more than 4000 researchers, designing (not building) sensors, chips, and doing a lot of consulting & research work in the area of smart things and IoT.
* A new buzzword [*digital twin*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_twin) which is defined as a digital replica of a living or non-living physical entity. 
* They do a lot of projects with cities, like mounting air quality sensors on parcel delivery cars, measuring water quality using thousands of chip sensors, collecting flow data of people and bicyclists in cities and buildings, and subsequently, use the data for simulations, prototyping, and building of proof of concepts.
* They always include ethical considerations and even have a team for it which is involved in all projects. It seems that they have a very holistic approach (and also the funding for ir). For example, in a big project with a government, they are also looking into the question if there is real value in IoT/digital twins for the government or if it just a hype.

Paul Kootwijk & Marcel Gerrits presented the dutch public railway infrastructure company [ProRail](https://www.prorail.nl/) and it’s innovation lab. An entertaining presentation with stories about bureaucracy and innovative projects on the rail.
* They make use of cheap sensors and try to use them almost everywhere:
  * Vibration sensors on bridges to detect truck collisions and help people to decide if trains can still run on this bridge or traffic has to be stopped. Test bridge was hit more than 40 times in several weeks.
  * Predictive maintenance and surveillance of railways, point switches, crossings, doors, etc.
  * Train sensors (on two trains at the moment) which can locate the train with a precision of 5cm to detect problems of tracks or catenary
* Big challenge for them: rollout of projects from proof on concept to production
* Currently no automated decisions are made but what if....one person in the audience asked about hacking attacks which could then black out public infrastructure. The answer was more like, yes, we heard about security and it seems that we have to think about it ;)


[Tom van Arman](https://twitter.com/tomvanarman) talked about showcases how data can be presented in the future:
* The [Lidar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar) technology is super expensive and it needs a lot of manual work to create wakable 3D environments.
* Usually 3D videos/flights are pre-rendered and it takes ages to compute it. They used the [Unreal game engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Engine) to create  3D environments of real objects (e.g. Rijksmuseum) which are walkable in real time.
* He also presented several projects and videos which show how enriched 3D environments can be used to present data. The video below shows an example which combines the 3D point cloud of the [Marineterrein](https://www.marineterrein.nl/) where the [Living Lab](https://www.living-lab.nl/) is located, with additional data and information about the projects of the Living Lab.
