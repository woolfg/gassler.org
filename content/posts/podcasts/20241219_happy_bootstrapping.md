With Open Source and SaaS to a Podcast Analytics Platform (#101)

[Happy Bootstrapping](https://happy-bootstrapping.podigee.io/101-mit-open-source-und-saas-zur-podcast-analytics-plattform-101)

In episode 101 of Happy Bootstrapping, Andreas Lehr spoke with Matthias Endler and me about Open Podcast, an innovative open-source analytics tool for podcasts. We dive deep into our journey of building the product, the myriad of technical challenges we overcame, and our strategic focus on B2B clients.

We discussed how we developed Open Podcast from our own experiences as podcast producers. Initially launched as an open-source project with funding from MediaTech Lab Bayern, we now offer both a free open-source version and a robust SaaS solution. The tool empowers podcast producers by consolidating their statistics from various platforms like Spotify and Apple Podcasts and generating automated, insightful reports.

Throughout the episode, we shared our experiences in building the product as a side project alongside our freelance work. We delved into the technical challenges we faced, such as integrating with different APIs and ensuring data privacy. Additionally, we discussed our strategy to focus on B2B clients, such as podcast agencies and large media houses, to effectively monetize the platform.

Andreas Lehr, the host of "Happy Bootstrapping," interviews founders and entrepreneurs about their journeys in building and scaling their businesses every week.
