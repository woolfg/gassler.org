With Open Source and SaaS to a Podcast Analytics Platform (#101)

[Happy Bootstrapping](https://happy-bootstrapping.podigee.io/101-mit-open-source-und-saas-zur-podcast-analytics-plattform-101)

In episode 101 of Happy Bootstrapping, Andreas Lehr spoke with Matthias Endler and me about Open Podcast, an open-source analytics tool for podcasts. We share our experiences in building the product, the technical challenges we faced, and our strategy to focus on B2B clients.

We discussed how we developed Open Podcast from our own experiences as podcast producers. Initially started as an open-source project with funding from MediaTech Lab Bayern, we now offer both a free open-source version and a SaaS solution. The tool helps podcast producers consolidate their statistics from various platforms like Spotify and Apple Podcasts and create automated reports.

Furthermore, we talked about the technical challenges we faced, such as integrating with different APIs and ensuring data privacy. We also shared our strategy to focus on B2B clients, such as podcast agencies and large media houses, to monetize the platform.

Andreas Lehr is host of the "Happy Bootstrapping" podcast and interviews founders and entrepreneurs about their experiences in building and growing their businesses.
