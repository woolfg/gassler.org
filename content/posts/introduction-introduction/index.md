Well done, if you start your presentation like that you have lost with absolute certainty around 99% of your audience. Even if this is an extreme case which I already encountered more than once, many people ignore the importance of the introduction. Usually the experience level of the audience is very diverse, thus, the aim of the introduction is to pick up the audience at their levels of experience and guide them to a common level. The length of the introduction is dependent on the total length of the presentation but for a typical talk of 25 minutes I would reserve at least 10 minutes for a good introduction and motivation of the topic.

With every formula you show, you lose half of your audience
Slide numbers

"Sorry, can you go 5 slides back? Oh no, one more, please. Oh, maybe the next one?" Have you already experienced that in the Q&A part of a presentation? You can encounter such a situation at almost every conference at least once. It takes time, is annoying but can be easily solved by just adding slide numbers: "I have a question regarding the results on slide 10"…Voila.
